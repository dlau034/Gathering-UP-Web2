              <h2>Kenneth Su</h2>
              <h4>FOUNDER</h4>
              <p>While most children sought to become Astronauts or Presidents of the United States, Ken, wanted to be a mathematician as a child.  As he grew older, he realized that he had a gift for math, but wasn&#39;t really that passionate about it.  That dream was finally laid to rest when he took a Linear Algebra course in college and only managed to get a &#39;D&#39;.  He realized then, that he wasn&#39;t that talented and decided to learn more about computers instead.
              </br>
              </br>
              Since graduating college, Ken has taken a scorched earth tactic to his career and has had a total of nine full time jobs and two consulting jobs.  Seven of those jobs were in large global financial companies.  The most exciting and stressful was working at Barclay&#39;s capital during the financial crisis as Barclay&#39;s purchased Lehman Brothers.  The most memorable was a one year stint working for HP in Singapore.
              </br>
              </br>
              After suffering through long hours and stressful working conditions in Wall St, he finally decided to take the plunge to create his own startup. He figured that starting a company can&#39;t be as stressful as working on a trading floor... or can it?</p>

              <h2>Ashley Villarreal</h2>
              <h4>Writer</h4>
              <p>
              Born, but not raised in Texas, Ashley spent the first thirteen years of her life living in cities across the Southern U.S., Mexico and Spain. The most recent thirteen years have been split (somewhat unfairly) between Arizona and New York City. 
              </br>
              </br>
              Ashley developed a deep obsession with storytelling from a young age, which later propelled her to seek a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Arizona in 2008. She worked for a few glorious years as an underpaid journalist covering everything from politics, health care and the arts before seeking full-time work in project management at a large international nonprofit. 
              </br>
              </br>
              After several years spent working in research and program development, she&#39;s returned to her journalistic roots to dedicate her time and skills to building strategic communications for creative ventures. 
              </br>
              </br>
              In her free time, she cooks, eats and just thinks about food. She also never misses an opportunity to thrift interesting things in NYC and repurpose used goods for better use.

                <h2>Matthew Caprioli</h2>
                <h4>Writer</h4>
                <p>Matt(hew) was born in California, grew up in Alaska, went to college in Massachusetts, and now lives in New York. For most his life, Matthew thought he would be a professional figure skater. Realizing at 13 that this was social suicide, Matthew turned to academics, mainly English.
              </br>
              </br>
                He went to Clark University, met people hailing from all over the world, and did a lot of mattress surfing. He eventually moved back to Anchorage, Alaska and worked a research assistant for a social research company, where he learned fun facts like it takes 2 to 3 days for people in Bethel, Alaska to send one email.
              </br>
              </br>
                He joined GatheringUP because he wants to hear personal stories or, “news of the human condition.” Matthew is also a music writer for Quip Magazine. His personal projects include learning to play the piano, trying to speak Spanish and French, and reading everything in the world.  Matthew is happy to speak with literally anyone, so shoot him an email sometime.

                <h4>Writer</h4>
                <p>Aside from the four years spent getting his History degree from the University of Vermont, Jeremy has always lived in suburban Nanuet, New York (it&#39;s quite nice, look it up sometime) and has been coming to the big city his whole life.
                </br>
                </br>  
                With previous experience writing on topics ranging from the decision to drop the atomic bomb in World War Two, to the merits of Radiohead&#39;s eighth album, to how to properly dispose of household paints, Jeremy considers himself to be a pretty good writer. The challenge of writing about a place as diverse as New York City seemed like a logical thing to undertake.
                </br>
                </br>  
                In his free time, Jeremy enjoys listening to Talking Heads, watching science-fiction movies, and eating really good pizza.

                <h2>Joshua Gonzalez</h2>
                <h4>Marketing Intern</h4>
                Joshua Gonzalez was born in the Bronx and spent his early years of his life going to school. His mother decided to take his talents to Dominican Republic (home country of said mother) in &#39;99 and lived there until he was done with high school in &#39;08. Then moved back to the New York, in order to pursue a higher education. He started going to Kingsborough Community College majoring in accounting did two years (but did not complete his AA),and realized it was not for him. 
                </br>
                </br>  
                After this he transferred to Baruch College not being so sure of what exactly what he wanted to do. He interned at Major League Gaming where his friend Camber that told him about marketing and all the aspects about it and after dancing around what majors were interesting he decided upon marketing.
                Joshua enjoys competing in the video game Halo for the xbox. The comradery aspect of being in team, practicing every night and then going to the event to participate in the competition is what drives him to play. He also enjoys going to electronic dance music festivals.
